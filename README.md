## Bugs

I found there were issues with **Gallery** images not showing through 'GitHub Pages' and also one **Wireframe** image was not showing within this *README* file.

1. **Gallery** images paths/spelling were checked, and I found I needed to slightly amended the file paths, removing './' and making them relative. All images are now showing as designed.

2. One **Wireframe** image had one typo, a lowercase letter instead of uppercase. This was corrected and now the image is showing correctly with this *README* file.

## Bugs

1. I found there were issues with **Gallery** images not showing through 'GitHub Pages' and also one **Wireframe** image was not showing within this *README* file.

  - **Gallery** images paths/spelling were checked, and I found I needed to slightly amended the file paths, removing './' and making them relative. All images are now showing as designed.

  - One **Wireframe** image had one typo, a lowercase letter instead of uppercase. This was corrected and now the image is showing correctly with this *README* file.

2. Upon final testing - I found issues with the *navbar and tabs* responsiveness across devices.

  - I have added three *@media queries* to resolve the issues, and re-tested across all device sizes.
